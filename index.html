          For many years I have been working on living a holistic lifestyle,
          which has been a lot of ups and downs. I would be lying if I said it
          was an easy change. It has been anything but easy for me to really
          make changes which make my life better.
          <br />
          One thing I have learned along the way is that no matter what anyone
          says, no 1 specific diet, financial plans/budgets, coping skills, or
          even exercise plans work the same for everyone. We live in this world
          where someone is always coming out with a new plan, and then try to
          make it seem like everyone will have the same result. But the truth
          is, what works for me, will not work for everyone else. The benefit to
          having a life coach like myself is that I will work with you to find
          what is best for you. As someone who is also neurodivergent, I can
          help you if you also fall into that category.
          <br />
          Whether you are neurodivergent or neurotypical, I want to help you to
          find your personal path to a successful future of a holistic health!
